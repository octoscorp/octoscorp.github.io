<h1>Welcome!</h1>
Welcome to the beginnings of me having my own web page. I'm sure this won't have any impact on the amount of links I send to people I know.

Note that this very much isn't completed; it's waiting on completion of a demo my game Third Law, at which point I'll be able to change over to Linux.
